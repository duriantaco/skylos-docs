## General

### What is Skylos?

Skylos is a static analysis tool for Python (and TypeScript) that detects:

- **Dead code:** Unused functions, imports, classes, variables
- **Security vulnerabilities:** SQL injection, command injection, SSRF, XSS
- **Code quality issues:** High complexity, deep nesting, mutable defaults

Unlike simple linters, Skylos uses taint analysis to trace data flow and framework awareness to reduce false positives.

### Is Skylos free?

Yes. Skylos is open source and free to use. The AI-powered features (`--fix`, `--audit`) require your own OpenAI or Anthropic API key.

### What Python versions are supported?

Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 are supported.

### Does Skylos work with my framework?

Skylos has built-in awareness for Django, Flask, FastAPI, Pydantic, and Pytest. Other frameworks work but may have more false positives for implicitly-called code.

### How is Skylos different from Pylint/Bandit?

| Tool | Focus | Approach |
|------|-------|----------|
| Pylint | Style + errors | Pattern matching |
| Bandit | Security | Pattern matching |
| Skylos | Dead code + Security + Quality | Taint analysis + Framework awareness |

Skylos catches vulnerabilities that pattern matchers miss (indirect data flows) and has fewer false positives for dead code (framework awareness).

## Installation & Setup

### How do I install Skylos?
```bash
pip install skylos
```

Verify with `skylos --version`.

### Do I need to configure anything?

No. Skylos works out of the box with sensible defaults. For customization, run `skylos init` to create a `[tool.skylos]` section in your `pyproject.toml`.

### How do I set up AI features?

Set an environment variable and use the appropriate flag:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
skylos . --fix
```

---

## Usage

### What's the basic command?
```bash
skylos .                              # Dead code only
skylos . --danger --quality --secrets # Full analysis
skylos . --danger --quality --gate    # With quality gate
```

### How do I scan a single file?
```bash
skylos path/to/file.py
```

### How do I exclude folders?
```bash
skylos . --exclude-folder tests --exclude-folder migrations
```

Or in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.skylos]
exclude = ["tests", "migrations"]
```

### How do I ignore specific rules?

Inline suppression:
```python
def function():  # noqa: skylos
    pass
```

Global suppression in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.skylos]
ignore = ["SKY-D201", "SKY-L002"]
```

### How do I get JSON output?
```bash
skylos . --json -o report.json
```

### What does --confidence do?

Filters findings by certainty. Default is 60. Use `--confidence 80` for fewer, safer results or `--confidence 40` to include more uncertain findings.

---

## False Positives

### Why is my Flask/Django route flagged as unused?

Skylos should detect framework decorators. If it doesn't, ensure the file imports the framework, check for non-standard decorator patterns, or add `# noqa: skylos`. Report undetected patterns on GitHub.

### Why is dynamically-called code flagged?

Static analysis can't see runtime behavior like `getattr()` calls. Use `--trace` to capture runtime calls, add `# noqa: skylos`, or lower the confidence threshold.

### Why are my test fixtures flagged?

Skylos should recognize pytest fixtures. Ensure the file matches test patterns (`test_*.py`) and has the `@pytest.fixture` decorator. Report issues with a minimal example.

### How do I report a false positive?

Open an issue at [github.com/duriantaco/skylos](https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos) with a minimal code example, Skylos output, expected behavior, and version.

## Security Scanning

### What vulnerabilities does Skylos detect?

SQL injection, command injection, SSRF, XSS, path traversal, dangerous functions (eval, exec, pickle), weak cryptography, disabled SSL verification, and hardcoded secrets. See [Rule Reference](/rule-reference) for details.

### What is taint analysis?

Taint analysis tracks how untrusted data flows through your code. If tainted data reaches a dangerous function, it's flagged:
```python
user_id = request.args.get("id")                      # Source: tainted
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"   # Propagation
cursor.execute(query)                                  # Sink: flagged
```

### How do I fix a SQL injection finding?

Use parameterized queries:
```python
# Vulnerable
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")

# Safe
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
```

### Why is my code flagged but I sanitize the input?

Skylos may not recognize custom sanitization functions. Use standard library sanitization, add inline suppression with a comment, or report the pattern for recognition.

---

## Quality Gate

### How does the quality gate work?

The gate compares findings against thresholds in your config:
```toml
[tool.skylos.gate]
fail_on_critical = true
max_security = 0
max_quality = 10
```

If thresholds are exceeded, `skylos --gate` exits with code 1.

### Can I bypass the gate?

In interactive terminals, you'll be prompted to bypass unless `strict = true`. In CI/CD, the gate cannot be bypassed.

### How do I set up the gate in CI?
```yaml
- name: Quality Gate
  run: skylos . --danger --quality --gate
```

See [CI/CD Integration](/ci-cd) for full examples.

## Performance

### How fast is Skylos?

| Codebase Size | Time |
|---------------|------|
| 10K lines | < 2 seconds |
| 100K lines | < 10 seconds |
| 1M lines | < 60 seconds |

Security scanning (`--danger`) adds ~20% overhead.

### How can I make it faster?

Exclude non-essential folders, scan only changed files, or skip security scanning if you only need dead code detection.

---

## Troubleshooting

### 'skylos' command not found

Ensure you installed it with `pip install skylos` and your virtual environment is activated. Try `python -m skylos.cli .` as an alternative.

### Analysis takes forever

You may be scanning a large directory. Use `--verbose` to check what's being analyzed and add `--exclude-folder` for large non-source directories.

### Getting different results locally vs CI

Check for different Python versions, exclusion settings, or Skylos versions between environments. Pin the version in CI with `pip install skylos==2.6.0`.

### Error parsing a file

Skylos requires valid Python syntax. Verify with `python -m py_compile path/to/file.py` and fix any syntax errors.

### AI features not working

Verify your API key is set (`echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`), the key is valid, and you have available credits/quota.
