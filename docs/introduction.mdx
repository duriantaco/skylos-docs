**Skylos** is a developer-security platform that runs entirely in your local environment or CI/CD pipeline. Unlike SaaS scanners that require code uploads, Skylos performs Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and runtime analysis on your infrastructure.

## Core Capabilities

Skylos is composed of four integrated engines:


  ### Scanner (SAST)
    Analyzes AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to find security flaws, dead code, and logic bugs without running the code.
  
  ### Auto-Pilot
    A runtime agent that hooks into your Python environment to track real-world function usage and detect "Zombie Code."
  
  ### Gatekeeper
    A policy enforcer for CI/CD that blocks deployments based on security severity or quality metrics.
  
  ### Fixer
    An auto-remediation engine using LibCST and Generative AI (OpenAI/Anthropic) to repair code safely.
  


## Supported Ecosystems

Skylos currently supports the following languages and frameworks.

### Languages

| Language | Static Analysis | Runtime Tracking | AI Repair |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Python** (3.9+) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **TypeScript** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **JavaScript** | ⚠️ (Beta) | ❌ | ❌ |

### Frameworks

Skylos includes specific heuristics to support "magic" patterns in these frameworks [cite: 478-480]:

* **Web:** Django, Flask, FastAPI, Starlette, Pydantic.
* **Async:** Uvicorn, Celery.
* **Testing:** Pytest, Unittest.

## Architecture & Data Privacy

Skylos operates on a **Local-First** model.

* **No SaaS Account:** You do not need to create a Skylos account to run the scanner.
* **Data Residency:** All scan results and usage telemetry (`.skylos_usage.json`) are stored on your local disk.
* **AI Privacy:** When using `--fix` or `--audit`, code snippets are sent to your configured LLM provider (OpenAI or Anthropic) via their respective APIs. No code is stored by Skylos.
